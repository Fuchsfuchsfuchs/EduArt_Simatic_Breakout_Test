# EduArt_Simatic_Breakout_Test

## Introduction

This repository contains the ECAD Files and the code for a project which was created in the time at my Internship at EduArt Robotics. On the top side of the Eduard Robot sits a breakout Board for the Simatic IoT 2050 GPIO Pins. The Board is connected to the IPC with a flat ribbon cable which could be prone to cracks. So a simple solution to test the Robot before shipping was searched for. You plug the Simatic_Breakout_Test in and run the IOT_PCB_TEST program on the Robot. LEDs indicate for each pin if the connection works.
